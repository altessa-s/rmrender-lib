/* TEXT means native Helvetica line shaping/fallback and baseline drawing,
 * compatible with the text metrics provider used to build the plan.
 * FILL_STROKE means one native nonzero fill/outline operation with separate
 * colors/alphas. MITER means miter joins with limit 10 for stroked geometry.
 * IMAGE means PNG/JPEG decoding and affine placement through the path clip.
 * ERASE means ordered contour subtraction, including native stroked-outline
 * conversion when needed; GROUP means isolated transparency for contiguous tokens.
 * A backend must close active groups on end AND abort. Never advertise a capability
 * that is unavailable on the current runtime.
 * No native objects appear in this interface. Callbacks see borrowed immutable
 * commands only during the call. State lives in context, not global variables.
 * On ANY failure after begin is invoked, abort is called exactly once, including
 * a failed begin/end. No end after failed draw. Abort must tolerate partial init.
 * The backend is responsible for transactional output and releasing its resources.
 * Callbacks return a status; execution identifies the failing draw in error. */
